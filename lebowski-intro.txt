Way out west there was this fella... fella I wanna tell ya about. Fella by the name of Jeff
Lebowski. At least that was the handle his loving parents gave him, but he never had much use
for it himself. Mr. Lebowski, he called himself "The Dude". Now, "Dude" - that's a name no one
would self-apply where I come from. But then there was a lot about the Dude that didn't make a
whole lot of sense. And a lot about where he lived, likewise. But then again, maybe that's why I
found the place so darned interestin'. They call Los Angeles the "City Of Angels." I didn't find
it to be that, exactly. But I'll allow there are some nice folks there. 'Course I can't say I've
seen London, and I ain't never been to France. And I ain't never seen no queen in her damned
undies, so the feller says. But I'll tell you what - after seeing Los Angeles, and this here
story I'm about to unfold, well, I guess I seen somethin' every bit as stupefyin' as you'd see in
any of them other places. And in English, too. So I can die with a smile on my face, without
feelin' like the good Lord gypped me. Now this here story I'm about to unfold took place back in
the early '90s - just about the time of our conflict with Sad'm and the I-raqis. I only mention it
because sometimes there's a man... I won't say a hero, 'cause, what's a hero? But sometimes,
there's a man. And I'm talkin' about the Dude here. Sometimes, there's a man, well, he's the man
for his time and place. He fits right in there. And that's the Dude, in Los Angeles. And even if
he's a lazy man - and the Dude was most certainly that. Quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles
County, which would place him high in the runnin' for laziest worldwide. But sometimes there's a
man, sometimes, there's a man. Aw. I lost my train of thought here. But... aw, hell. I've done
introduced him enough.
